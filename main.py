    #NETWORK OPERATIONS GO THERE: READ FROM ML BUFFER, BASED ON NETWORK QUALITY SEND SOME DATA PACKETS AT FIXED RATE TO THE SERVER. GOOD IF SENDING PACKET IS NONBLOCKING BUT HAVE TO ENSURE WHEN WE WANT TO SEND NEW PACKET PREVIOUS IS ALREADY SENT

    #TO DO: AFTER GETTING max_sit_time functionality COMPARE SITTING TIME WITH TIME SET BY SERVER. IF LARGER THAN SERVER TIME OVERWRITE HAPTIC TO GIVE OUT CONTINUOUS PULSE


#TO DO: Calibration, testing code, ADC I2C library, model training, haptic implementation


'''
-Network in background if can make that: FIND LIBRARY THAT ALLOWS THAT
-If have time, sampling is in interrupt that will interfere with ML operation but will ensure fast and continuous data collection. CANNOT PARALLEL I2C COMMUNICATIONS BUT IMPROVE SOMEHOW??? (multiple I2C ports?)
-ML stuff will be in the main While(1) loop
